# Introduce
`Http4J` is an efficient and convenient network request tool developed based on Java's `HttpURLConnection` class.
<br><br>
It originated in <kbd>[Rifle](https://github.com/Huyemt/Rifle)</kbd>, and this library stripped it out as a package alone.
<br><br>
If you have used Python's `requests` library, you will be able to get started with `Http4J` quickly.
